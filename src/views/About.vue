            <p class="text-muted">
            We as a company believe that there is more to a company than just the product. We like to believe that our customers are likeminded. So EZvolt is more than a solution to a modern problem, we stand for ecological and ethical responsibility. </p>
            <p class="text-muted"> 
            We make our battery out of materials we gather from mines with ethical work conditions. We checked (and double checked) every step of the process to make sure every stap was sound. Furthermore we tried to make every step as eco friendly as possible. 
            So we insist that every step is sustainable. </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
            Also we made sure that every battery we make is completely lactose and glucose free. Our battery is 100% vegan. So as you can see, we invest in the durability, sustainability and eco-friendliness of all our products.
